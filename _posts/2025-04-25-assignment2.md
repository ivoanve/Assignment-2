## Static Personal Blog Website Report

**Student Name**: Ivonne Andrea Anave Zenteno  
**Student ID**: LS2408221  
**Submission Date**: 25/04/2025

## 1. Objective

The goal of this assignment was to create and deploy a static personal blog website using tools such as **Jekyll**, **Markdown**, **Git**, and **GitHub Pages**. The website serves as a central location to present my course assignments, starting with Assignment 1.
---
## 2. Website Setup and Deployment

I used **Jekyll** with the official GitHub Pages theme jekyll-theme-minimal to build and style the site.

### Steps followed:

1. Created the GitHub repository: Basics-of-Software-Technology
2. Configured Jekyll with the following _config.yml:

   title: "Assignment Portfolio"
   baseurl: "/Basics-of-Software-Technology"
   url: "https://ivoanve.github.io"
   theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
   
3. Created the folders _posts/ and assets/, and added Markdown posts for each assignment.
4. Customized layout using minimal HTML and Markdown only (as jekyll-theme-minimal is intentionally lightweight).
5. Deployed the site to GitHub Pages, now publicly accessible at:

## 3. Git Version Control

I used Git throughout the project to track meaningful changes. Below is a summary of important commits:

| Commit Message                        | Purpose                                     |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| init: basic Jekyll setup           | Started the Jekyll site structure           |
| add: assignment1 markdown          | Added content and code for Assignment 1     |
| change: updated _config for theme  | Switched to jekyll-theme-minimal            |
| docs: wrote assignment2 report     | Added this report to the site               |
| style: improved homepage layout    | Simplified structure, better readability    |

Each commit represents a logical step in the siteâ€™s creation or improvement process.

## 4. Integration of Previous Work

Assignment 1 was integrated directly into the blog as a separate post. It includes:

- Complete documentation in Markdown  
- C and Python code for matrix multiplication  
- System configuration and output validation  
---
## 5. Tools and Frameworks Used

- **Jekyll** â€” static site generator  
- **jekyll-theme-minimal** â€” lightweight and clean theme  
- **Markdown** â€” for writing content  
- **Git** â€” version control  
- **GitHub Pages** â€” for free deployment  
- **VS Code** â€” editing and previewing

## 6. Challenges and Learnings

- ðŸ§© Managing the baseurl was key to making links work correctly.  
- ðŸ’» Learned how to customize a minimal theme without breaking the layout.  
- ðŸ”§ Fixed issues with Liquid syntax by using {% raw %} around C code.  

These small but practical problems helped reinforce my understanding of static site generation and Markdown formatting.
---
## 7. Conclusion

This assignment helped me learn how to:

- Set up and deploy a Jekyll site using GitHub Pages  
- Manage a project with Git and meaningful commits  
- Document technical work clearly with Markdown  
- Share assignments in a professional and public format  

It provided a solid foundation for publishing the rest of my assignments online.
