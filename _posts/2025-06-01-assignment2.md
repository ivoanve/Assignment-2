## 1. Objective

The goal of this assignment was to create and deploy a static personal blog website using tools such as **Jekyll**, **Markdown**, **Git**, and **GitHub Pages**. The website serves as a central location to present my course assignments, starting with Assignment 1.

## 2. Website Setup and Deployment

I used **Jekyll** with the official GitHub Pages theme `jekyll-theme-minimal` to build and style the site.

### Steps followed:

1. Created the GitHub repository: `Basics-of-Software-Technology`
2. Configured Jekyll with the following `_config.yml`:

```yaml
title: "Assignment Portfolio"
baseurl: "/Basics-of-Software-Technology"
url: "https://ivoanve.github.io"
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
